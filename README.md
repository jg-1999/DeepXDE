# DeepXDE

This repository serves a dual purpose centered around the [DeepXDE](https://github.com/lululxvi/deepxde)

DeepXDE ibrary, is a very useful open-source library for solving differential equations using deep learning.

This repository will be mainly separeted into 2 other repositories

## ðŸ“š Documentation Replication & Exploration

- The first part will be focused on recreating and experimenting with official DeepXDE examples. 
- These come annotated with personalized explanations and commentary to deepen understanding and make the original content more approachable.

## ðŸ”¬ Research & Personal Projects

- On the other hand, this second part of the repository, will host independent research projects showing DeepXDE's capabilities, particularly in the area of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and scientific machine learning.

- The main idea is to create custom applications designed to explore real-world phenomena
